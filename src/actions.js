// side note - it is better to declare a variable that hold our action type so that it becomes more easier to debug when there is an error. hence the reason for this:

export const DECREASE = "DECREASE";
export const INCREASE = "INCREASE";
export const REMOVE = "REMOVE";
export const CLEAR_CART = "CLEAR_CART";
export const GET_TOTALS = "GET_TOTALS";
export const TOGGLE_AMOUNT = "TOGGLE_AMOUNT";
